Repository for web development class (CS444) at Binghamton University

## Note
This repository contains a comprehensive contacts web application that was developed over several projects throughout the semester (Fall 2023). The backend development progresses from prj1-sol to prj3-sol, with the finalized backend residing in the prj3-sol directory. On the frontend side, there are two distinct versions: prj4-sol (vanilla JavaScript) and prj5-sol (React). Feel free to explore the code.
